# Möbius Strip Modeling in Python

This project implements a 3D parametric model of a **Möbius strip** using Python. It computes key geometric properties such as surface area and edge length through numerical methods and visualizes the surface in 3D.

## 🌀 Features

1.Parametric 3D modeling of a Möbius strip
2.Numerical approximation of:
  - Surface area
  - Edge length
3. 3D visualization using `matplotlib`

## 📐 Parametric Equations Used

The Möbius strip is modeled using the following equations:

x(u,v) = (R + v * cos(u / 2)) * cos(u)
y(u,v) = (R + v * cos(u / 2)) * sin(u)
z(u,v) = v * sin(u / 2)


Where:
1.`u ∈ [0, 2π]` is the angle around the loop
2.`v ∈ [-w/2, w/2]` spans the strip width
3.`R` is the centerline radius
4.`w` is the strip width

## 🧠 Project Structure

1.`mobius_strip.py`: Main script with the `MobiusStrip` class.
  - `__init__`: Initializes the strip with radius, width, and resolution.
  - `_generate_mesh()`: Computes the 3D mesh using the parametric equations.
  - `compute_surface_area()`: Uses the cross product of partial derivatives and numerical integration (trapezoidal rule).
  - `compute_edge_length()`: Approximates total edge length from two boundary loops.
  - `plot()`: Renders a 3D plot of the Möbius strip.

## 📊 Output

Surface Area ≈ 1.8856  
Edge Length ≈ 12.6223

## 📦 Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib

## Code Structure:

1.The code defines a MobiusStrip class encapsulating all logic.

2.Parameters like R, w, and n are configurable.

3.It uses NumPy for computation and Matplotlib for 3D plotting.

4.The core methods include mesh generation, surface area computation, edge length approximation, and visualization.

## Surface Area Approximation:

1.We use the trapezoidal rule over the parameter domain.

2.The surface area is calculated as the double integral of the norm of the cross product of partial derivatives of the position vector (standard method for parametric surfaces).

## Edge Length Approximation:

1.The edge consists of two loops: one for v = -w/2 and one for v = w/2.

2.We concatenate points along both loops and use finite differences to estimate arc length.

## Challenges Faced:

1.Handling correct indexing and spacing (du, dv) was essential for accurate numerical integration.

2.Ensuring the mesh resolution was high enough to approximate geometry and integrals precisely.

3.Proper cross product calculations required reshaping gradients and using vector norms correctly.
